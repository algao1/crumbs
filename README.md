# üçû crumbs

**Breadcrumbs of knowledge**. A collection of small(ish?), playground projects. Mostly for learning purposes and for fun. If they grow too big, maybe I'll move them out of here.

Probably will make a blog out of these when I get the time.

## p2p_rpc
A toy implementation of a peer-to-peer (p2p) network over gRPC using [Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul) for service discovery.

## dbs/keg
A simple no-dependency disk-based key-value store, written for fun.

## dbs/lsm
A basic LSM-tree based key-value store, built mostly from scratch and performs relatively ok. Inspired in part by this well-written [post](https://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2023/04/19/how-rocksdb-works/).
