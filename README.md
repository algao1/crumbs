# üçû crumbs

**Breadcrumbs of knowledge**. A collection of smallish, playground projects; mostly for learning purposes and for fun. Probably will make a blog out of these when I get the time.

### Cache
- **LRU** - A LRU cache

### Database
- **Keg** - A simple no-dependency disk-based key-value store, based on [Bitcask](https://github.com/basho/bitcask).
- **LSM** - A basic LSM-tree based key-value store, built mostly from scratch and performs ok. Inspired in part by this well-written [post](https://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2023/04/19/how-rocksdb-works/).

### Misc
- **p2p_rpc** - A toy implementation of a peer-to-peer (p2p) network over gRPC using [Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul) for service discovery.
